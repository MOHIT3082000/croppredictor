🌱 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project builds a Crop Recommendation System using Random Forest Classifier to suggest the best crop based on soil and climate conditions. The model is trained on a dataset containing essential agricultural parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall to determine the most suitable crop for farming.

🚀 Features
Data Preprocessing: Loads and cleans agricultural data.
Model Training: Implements a Random Forest Classifier for crop recommendation.
Prediction & Accuracy: Evaluates the model performance and predicts the best crop.
User Input: Allows users to input soil & weather parameters to get crop recommendations.
📂 Dataset
The dataset contains multiple agricultural attributes affecting crop growth. The model uses this data to learn patterns and make accurate recommendations.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Joblib (Model Persistence)
